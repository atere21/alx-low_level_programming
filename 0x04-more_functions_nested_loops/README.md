2-mul.c - function that multiplies two integers.

3-print_numbers.c - function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4-print_most_numbers.c - function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4, followed by a new line.

5-more_numbers.c - function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line 10 times.

6-print_line.c - function that draws a straight line of length n in the terminal, followed by a new line.

7-print_diagonal.c - function that draws a diagonal line of length n in the terminal.

8-print_square.c - function that prints a square of size n, followed by a new line.

9-fizz_buzz.c - prints the numbers from 1 to 100, separated by a space, followed by a new line. For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number. For the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
